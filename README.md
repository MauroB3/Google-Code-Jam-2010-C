# Google Code Jam 2010

Here's my Haskell solution for the problem C of the qualification round of 2010.

## Quick resume

The program is made for a roller coaster who makes some rides over day and it returns the total money that it did.

[You can see the full explanation here.](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/433101/dashboard#s=p2) 

## Important information

At the moment, this program only works with the small test cases file. I'm still working to do it more efficient to run the large test cases file. Any contribution is welcome.
